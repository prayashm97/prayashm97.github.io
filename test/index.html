            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> I am a 2nd year Software Engineering student at University of Guelph, Canada. I am seeking a challenging and rewarding intern position where I can build my career as a Full Stack Developer. 
            </p>

        <section id="skillsSection">
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p> I am familiar with Android SDK, Visual Studio, C#, MVC architecture, SQL Server, JQuery and Python. I can work in UNIX/Linux and Windows environments. I actively use Github as a version control service for my personal projects and school assignments. I believe knowledge of Git is very important when working in the industry. 
            </p><p>I am passionate about learning new things. During my free time I enjoy learning on my own using web resources, as I believe it is a necessity to keep myself actively up-to-date on emerging technologies.  I am currently in the process of learning ASP.NET Web APIs, AngularJS and Spring Framework.</p>

        <section id="experienceSection">
            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>I have completed projects and am comfortable in C, Java and Python. During my 3rd semester at University of Guelph, one of the main project for Software Design III (CIS 3250) was to design and implement a graphing calculator using Python and top down approach to design. It was a group project and as a core Developer for this project I was actively involved in all the phases of Software Development LifeCycle. We achieved 96% on the project and were awarded best design in class. </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the classroom, I have developed an Android app named Country Game, have worked on few side projects and have written technical documents for projects I have had ideas about.
