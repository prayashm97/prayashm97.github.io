            My name is Prayash Mishra. I am a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph. I recently completed my eight-month work term at Postmedia's corporate innovation lab, Postmedia Innovation Outpost in Kitchener, Ontario.  <br>
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
              Postmedia is one of Canada's largest news media company with over 200 news products. Their assets range from the biggest national newspaper <em>National Post </em> to hundreds of local publications like <em>Fort McMurray Today</em>. Their Kitchener development lab is involved with creating innovative solutions that help the company reach highly engaged and dispersed audience.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Through the university's co-op program, I have had the opportunity to apply my knowledge from school courses in the industry. 
            Here I will talk about some of the things I worked on and new things I learned while working with an amazing team at Postmedia I/O.

              Postmedia's Innovation Outpost is one of few Corporate Innovation Labs in Kitchener's Tannery Building. 
              Big corporations like TD, Manulife, Deloitte also have their innovation lab at the Tannery.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The Postmedia I/O team works on innovative projects that help the Postmedia Corporation as well as it's diverse audience. 
              One of the projects that the dev team worked on was the <em>National Post</em> skill on the <em>Amazon's Alexa</em>. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              One of the problems that the Outpost team is trying to solve is helping Postmedia's B2B customers reach a highly engaged and dispersed audience.
              Before the internet, all of the advertisements were on newspapers, with the newspaper industry slowly on a decline, all of the advertisements are on Facebook and other websites.
              The team is working on a platform which aggregates Postmedia's B2B customers' ad campaign information from other platforms and displays it in a clear manner so it's easier for them to understand how their campaigns are performing.

              There are 2 teams at the Outpost: Ampifii and the Postmedia Hub. Ampifii is used mostly for internal Postmedia employees and used to report on social campaigns from Facebook and Twitter. 
              The Hub is a public facing multi-platform reporting tool with many solutions like Search Engine Optimization, Landing Pages, Responsive Web Sites, etc. The Hub also uses the Ampifii API for their social reporting.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I was part of the Ampifii team, along with Jory who is also a co-op student from Guelph. The Ampifii team was very small, 2 co-ops, David who is the Product Manager, Colin who is the lead developer, and Tyler who later joined the team.
              The tech stack for Ampifii was Ruby for backend and Knockout.js as a frontend framework. I had never worked with either of the technologies so I had a lot of fun learning. 
              When I would run into issues, Colin and Tyler were there to guide me. David works from Toronto so I joined him in the Toronto office for a week because I wanted to see the corporate environment. I also worked with designers when adding new features to the application. I was responsible for adding different plugins in order to make the user experience of Ampifii better. 
              With Ampifii being a Social reporting tool, I had the chance of learning the Facebook's Graph and Marketing API. I also learned a great deal about marketing terms like
              Conversions, Interaction, Impression, and how that translated for the client.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Towards the end of the co-op term, I was working on both Hub and Ampifii. 
              With Hub using the Ampifii, it made sense for us to work with the Hub team when they needed to add new features. The Hub's architecture was very different compared to Ampifii, because it's public facing, they were very strict in the releasing process. 
              Hub uses Node.js, React/Redux on their application, and I had worked with both technologies in the past so I was able to jump right in. The work I did on the Hub were mostly backend, like supporting new Facebook ad types for the platform. 
              While working at the Outpost, everyone was very helpful and I learned a lot about advertisements, learned a whole lot of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms), learned to use Facebook's APIs and experienced KW's hipster culture by going to Smile Tiger.

              I would say my biggest goal for the past 8 months was to learn every chance I get, and I am happy to say that I learned a lot. 
              I learned about development, UI/UX designing, some DevOps, new technologies, marketing, advertisements terms, networking, etc. Let's look at my goals in a more detailed manner:<br>
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Learning UX/UI Design</dt>
              <dd>The in-house designers Matt and Nicole helped me learn a lot about both UI and UX designs. 
                They gave me book recommendations as well as with answering any questions I had. 
                I also had the chance to learn about user testing, where the devs were involved with the designers to see how the user interact with the new features being added.
              </dd>
              <dt>Improving Front-end and Back-end</dt>
              <dd>
                By working on projects at the Outposts, I have been able to learn new frameworks and improve knowledge on web development.
              </dd>
              <dt>Working on personal projects</dt>
              <dd> In the past 8 months, I have learned React, Node.js with which I have been able to work on my personal projects for my portfolio.

              In conclusion, I think the Postmedia Innovation Outpost was the perfect place for me to have my first co-op experience because, 
              I got to first-hand experience working on enterprise level software, had the chance to work on both internal and public-facing platforms. 
              The team at the Outpost has been very helpful since the beginning, anytime I had a question about something for work or personal projects, they were able to take the time out of their day and help.
              The team placed a high degree of trust in my skills and dedication, and for that, I am incredibly grateful.
              <br>

            <p class="lead">
              I had a great co-op experience with the Postmedia I/O team, and I hope my future as a developer will be as great as the past 8 months.

        <p class="first-paragraph lead">

       </p>
        <p class="lead">
          All joking aside, I'd like to thank everyone at Postmedia for making my first co-op experience this amazing. I would also like to thank Guelph's co-op department for giving the students the ability to work while studying. I would like to thank Greg Klotz for taking the time to read through my work term report.
